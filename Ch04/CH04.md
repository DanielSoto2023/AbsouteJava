Check the demos and book for classes, pg 199 is where `this.` appears

`this.` is a statement to prevent conflicts when you declare a variable in the meathod header

```java
public void setDate(int month, int day, int year)
{
    this.month = monthString(month);
    this.day = day;
    this.year = year
}
```
basically w/o `this.` the month which is declared as `INT` would be tried to assigned a `STRING` but with this. it means the `instance variable` whatever that means

you can `return booleans` aswell, as expressions or not up to you

private variables are to be kept inside the class and out of the programmer's view, like if your calling a `meathod` in the class with another `meathod` example being `monthString` you can private it because you wont be using that outside
