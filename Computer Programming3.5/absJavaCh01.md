# Chapter 1 Check point questions and notes
This is where I type my notes and answers to questions

```
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        int a = 5;
        int b = 2;
        int c = a + b;
        String str = "A Message";
        System.out.println(str.length());
        System.out.println(c);
    }
```

**Primative Types**
boolean | true/false

char | single charecter

byte | -128 to 127 (short but shorter)

short | -32768 to 32767 (Int but shorter)

int | (-2147483648 to 2147483647)

long | int but longer

float | int but decimals

double | float but larger

you can assign values to anything higher in the list

byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double

experessions (math shortcuts)

x += 2 means x = x + 2

x -= b means x = x - b

x *= 2 means x = x * 2

x /= b means x = x / b

It evaluates x before it is been changed

x--; means x - 1
x++; means x + 1

example

```
int n = 2;
int valueProduced = 2 *(n++);
System.out.println(valueProduced);
System.out.println(n);
```
would print out

doing

++x or --x

does it before it is evaluated

leading to the same code producing

x *insert modulo symbol*= 100 means x = x *modulo* 100

x *= a + b means x = x * (a + b)


**Self Test Exersize 1.1**

1. Java is not a drink. Would be printed
2. ```
    System.out.println(I like Java.)
    System.out.println(I like Java.)
    System.out.println(You Like Tea.)
    ```
3. ```
    public class CodeYeah {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        }
    }
    ```
4. A compiler lets you run code

5. Java

6. Regular Code

7.  A bite code interperator

8. NiceClass.java

9. NiceClass.java

10. rate1, TimeLimit, numberOfWindows

11. Yes

12. ```
    int feet = 0, inches = 0;
    ```

13. ```
    int count = 0;
    double distance = 1.5;
    ```

14. ```
    int time = 2;
    int distance = time * 80;
    ```

15. ```
    double balance = 2, rate = 3, intrest = balance * rate;
    ```

16. The output is
```
b
c
c
```

17. 3 * x
    (3 * x) + y
    (x + y) / 7
    ((3 * x) + y) / (z + 2)

18.  0.0

19. the results are 
    ```
    2
    1
    ```
20. 5

21. 
a. 2.5
b. Dont know something happening
c. bruh

Type Casting basically allows you to do stuff with variables and store in a different variable like

double ans = n/(double)m;

where n and m are ints

the expression (double)m; is a type cast if it was 2 it would become 2.0

a type cast from float/double into int would remove anything past the decimal point

```
int i = 5.5; is illigal 
while
int i = (int)5.5;
isnt
```

22. result would be 3

23.
